Hello there!
If you're reading this, you're probably wondering what's happened here.
Well, basically, I got so frustrated with our original checkers program that I restarted from scratch.
In the folder "Final Attempt" You will find a PyCheckers.py file which I have worked very hard on for the past couple of hours.
Please do not touch this.
I think it would be best if we each had our own file. The needed functions should all be in place.
